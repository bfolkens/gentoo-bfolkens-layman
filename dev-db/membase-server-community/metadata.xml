Membase is a distributed key-value database management system, optimized for storing data behind interactive web applications. Membase automatically spreads data and I/O across servers. This "scale out" approach at the data layer permits virtually unlimited growth of transaction capacity, with linear increases in cost and constant per-operation performance.

Membase is in production behind thousands of applications, from shared-server deployments at Heroku to dedicated Membase clusters with hundreds of servers at Zynga and NHN.
